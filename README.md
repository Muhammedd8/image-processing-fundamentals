# Image Processing Fundamentals
This repository contains basic image processing algorithms implemented in three different ways:

- Manual (from scratch) using Python & NumPy
- Using OpenCV library
- Using MATLAB built-in functions

## Topics Covered
- Grayscale conversion
- Brightness & contrast adjustment
- Thresholding
- Negative image
- Histogram & histogram equalization
- Spatial filtering (Mean, Gaussian, Median)
- Edge detection (Sobel, Prewitt, Laplacian)
- Morphological operations (Dilation, Erosion, Opening, Closing)
- Image transformations (rotation, translation, resizing)
